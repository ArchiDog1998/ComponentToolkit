  It contains four features, Component/Parameter's layout changes, Parameter's Persistent data Control, Quick Connect Wire tools and Advanced Gumball. The latter two are the most important.
  
  
  Layout Change can change your component's style, also can add an icon on each param of component.
  
  
  Param's Control can make you quick set persistent data. Left click on text box can change the value, also can undo it. Right click on control can add a Component to set the params. You can also change control's type on settings.
  
  
  Quick Wire can make you add Components quickly. Connecting and releasing in the blank can open a menu to quick wire, you can also edit the list to make your own quick wire style! The save file is under Grasshopper Setting folder, called 'quickwire.json'.
  
  
  Advanced Gumball can be use in any geometry persistent param.
