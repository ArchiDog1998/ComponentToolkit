  Make persistent data much easier to set. Settings are under Display Menu.
  
  
  It contains three features, Component/Parameter's layout changes, Parameter's Persistent data Control and Advanced Gumball. The latter two are the most important.
  
  
  Layout Change can change your component's style, also can add an icon on each param of component.
  
  
  Param's Control can make you quick set persistent data. Left click on text box can change the value, also can undo it. Right click on control can add a Component to set the params. You can also change control's type on settings.
  
  
  Advanced Gumball can be use in any geometry persistent param.
  
  
  1.1.3 Notes:
  
  1. Hide control when geometry param is referenced.
  
  2. Default value will auto set when set one value on single control.
